# Tokenizer In LLM Large Language Model

Great question, Mathew! A tokenizer is a fundamental concept in programming, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. Itâ€™s like a linguistic scalpelâ€”it slices up text into manageable pieces called tokens. Here's how it works across different contexts:

ðŸ§  In Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A tokenizer breaks down text into:

- Words: "I love coding" â†’ ["I", "love", "coding"]
- Subwords: "unhappiness" â†’ ["un", "happi", "ness"]
- Characters: "Hi" â†’ ["H", "i"]
- Sentences: "Hello. How are you?" â†’ ["Hello.", "How are you?"]
  This helps models understand and process language more effectively.

ðŸ§® In Machine Learning Models (like Transformers)
Tokenizers convert text into numerical IDs that models can understand:

- "Hello" â†’ [15496] (depending on the tokenizer's vocabulary)
- These IDs are then fed into models like GPT or BERT for training or inference.
  Popular tokenizers include:
- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) â€“ used in GPT models
- WordPiece â€“ used in BERT
- SentencePiece â€“ used in multilingual models

ðŸ§° In Programming (e.g., compilers or interpreters)
Tokenizers (or lexical analyzers) break code into:

- Keywords: if, else, return
- Identifiers: variable names
- Operators: +, -, =
- Literals: numbers, strings
  This is the first step in parsing and compiling code.
