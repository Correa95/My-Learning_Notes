# Optimization Definition

Optimization in neural networks is the process of adjusting the model's parameters‚Äîtypically the weights and biases‚Äîto minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual targets. This is done by minimizing a loss function, which quantifies how far off the predictions are from the ground truth.

‚öôÔ∏è What Is an Optimization Method?
An optimization method (or optimizer) is an algorithm that updates the parameters of the neural network during training to reduce the loss. It uses gradients computed via backpropagation to guide these updates.

üîë Key Concepts:

- Loss Function: Measures prediction error (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy).
- Gradient Descent: Core algorithm that moves parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the loss.
- Learning Rate: Controls the size of each update step.
- Momentum: Helps accelerate updates in consistent directions and dampens oscillations.
- Regularization: Techniques like L2 penalty to prevent overfitting.

üöÄ Common Optimization Algorithms
| Optimizer | Description | Use Case Example |
| SGD | Stochastic Gradient Descent; updates weights using one or few samples | Simple image classification |
| Adam | Adaptive Moment Estimation; combines momentum and adaptive learning rates | NLP tasks, deep CNNs |
| RMSprop | Scales learning rate based on recent gradients | Recurrent Neural Networks |
| Adagrad | Adapts learning rate for each parameter based on past gradients | Sparse data problems |
| AdamW | Variant of Adam with better weight decay handling | Transformer-based models |

üìö Example Use Case: Image Classification with CNN
Scenario:
You‚Äôre training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (e.g., MNIST dataset).
Optimization Setup:

- Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Epochs: 10‚Äì20
  Process:
- Forward pass computes predictions.
- Loss function evaluates prediction error.
- Backpropagation calculates gradients.
- Adam optimizer updates weights using gradients and internal moment estimates.
- Repeat for multiple epochs until loss converges.
