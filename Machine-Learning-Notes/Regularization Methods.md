# Regularization Definition

Regularization in neural networks refers to techniques used to prevent overfittingâ€”when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. These methods add constraints or modifications to the training process to encourage the model to generalize better.

ðŸ§  What Is Regularization?
Regularization methods aim to reduce model complexity or penalize extreme parameter values, helping the network learn more robust patterns rather than memorizing noise.
